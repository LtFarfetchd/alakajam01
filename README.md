# Marc and Adam's entry for Alakajam #09

Saturday 20/06/20 to Tuesday 24/06/20
Commencing 5am

Theme: CONNECTIONS

## Set-up instructions

- clone the repo
- open the `/ProjectFiles` directory in Unity
- make the required sacrifice to the unity gods
- done!

## Rules

- don't work directly on `master`
  - create a branch off master and open a pull request when done
- try to commit regularly
- try to keep branch names and commit messages meaningful, e.g.
  - `feature/character-movement` for feature-type branches
  - `bugfix/character-death-not-triggering` for bug fix-type branches
  - `art/character-sprites` for art asset-type branches
  - `audio/ambient-sounds` for music/effect-type branches
  - `"mapping player input to character instance vars"` as a commit message
